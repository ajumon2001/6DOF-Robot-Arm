# 🤖 6-DOF Robotic Arm – Group Project

This repository showcases the complete development process of our **6 Degrees of Freedom (6-DOF) Robotic Arm**, built as part of our Robotics coursework at Heriot-Watt University.

Our robot is capable of complex articulated motions and precision manipulation, built using custom-designed parts, 3D printing, and low-cost sensors. It was designed for automated pin insertion tasks and showcases skills in kinematics, CAD design, embedded systems, and teamwork.
